# Flack
Flask is a clone version of Slack. This project uses SocketIO for transferring messages and LocalStorage for storing data.
Also for storing some of the essentials i have used csv file for channels and user credentials. I know this isn't a good way of storing data but the
main focus here is to store all the data Locally and not in any database. just for pratice:)
